   Askuity provided retailers with a comprehensive dashboard and reporting application to analyze their sales data across different retailers. During my time at Askuity, I was promoted to the position of Staff Front-End Developer. In this role, my main focus was leading the transition from a hybrid application of Angular 1 & 2 to React.js.

    When I joined Askuity, they had already started the process of migrating from Angular 1 to Angular 2. I collaborated with the team to plan and execute the remainder of the transition, all while they were simultaneously launching new products. By adopting an agile development methodology, we were able to accelerate the timeframe for delivering solutions to our clients.</p>
<p>As our partnership with Home Depot progressed, we decided to migrate to React.js to align with other departments within the organization. Additionally, we adopted their design system and integrated the Ant Design system. This integration proved to be challenging as one system was developed using web components, while the other was built on React.js. Ultimately, we successfully integrated the two systems by creating React components that wrapped around the web components.</p>
