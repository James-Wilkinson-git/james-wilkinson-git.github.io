<p>
  I was the only dedicated front-end engineer at HiMama, I devoted most of my
  time to educating the full-stack developers on React and JavaScript best
  practices.
</p>
<p>
  I developed a plan to transition their old jQuery views over to React, and a
  technology plan to get from the current state to a future of micro-services,
  multiple-spas, and the ability to adopt a mono-repo or multiple repo
  paradigms.

  I also developed a decision tree for when to use the old technology versus the
  new technology
