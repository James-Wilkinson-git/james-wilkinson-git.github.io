<p>At ICF Olson I managed a team of front-end developers across various stacks. Our primary client was Boston Pizza where we redesigned their entire online ordering system using Adobe AEM, JavaScript and Bootstrap.</p>
<p>Boston Pizza had several technical challenges to overcome such as schedules that spanned multipled days for overnight operation, timing for ordering to factor in prep and delivery time of orders, and implementing a cutting edge design.</p>
<p>I also worked with our vendor partners to negotiate contracts for rates for our Google API implementations, Adobe implementations, and other marketing tracking platforms. I implemented various E-Commerce tracking tags managed through Adobe DTM.</p>
<p>In addition to Boston Pizza I also frequently travelled to Grand Rapids to work with our client Amway. We designed and implemented a new internal education site that used Okta for single sign on, and interacted with various APIs to retrive data relevant to the user. </p>
