<p>While at info-tech I began transitioning all of their flash applications
    over to javascript. We then began the process of creating a new application in 
    ruby on rails, including theming, templating, and implementing a design system

<p>Later in my career at Info-Tech I redesigned their video production process and 
    began teaching the researchers how to present in front of a camera and editing
    their videos for posting on the new rails site. This included a custom web player
    with Google Analytics tracking and integrations with the surronding webpage.

<p> I also developed an internal site that was deployed to TVs across the office
    to showcase the sales achivemenets in real time, and display company news and events
